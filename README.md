## End to End ML project 
This application predicts students’ mathematics performance based on demographic and academic characteristics contained in the stud.csv dataset, which includes gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, participation in test preparation courses, and reading and writing scores. The data was preprocessed through cleaning, categorical encoding, and feature scaling, and then used to train a supervised machine learning model capable of estimating math scores. The solution is implemented as a web application built with Flask, providing an interactive form where users can input student information and instantly receive a prediction generated by the model. The project is structured into modules that handle the prediction pipeline and can be deployed on platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or Azure, showcasing the integration of data analytics, artificial intelligence, and web deployment in a practical case applied to the educational domain.

To implement:

Clone the repository

open in vscode the MLproject file

in the terminal (command prompt) enter "pip install -r requirements.txt" and enter

run the data_ingestion script by entering "python src/components/data_ingestion.py" and enter

run the app by entering "python app.py"

open a internet browser and key in "127.0.0.5000/predictdata"

select the variables for prediction

click on predict Maths Score
